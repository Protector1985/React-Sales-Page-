A quick Frontend Mentor project to stay sharp with my CSS skills. 

I used Flexbox for the layout and followed a "mobile first" approach. The layout has an appropriate
break point where it switches to the desktop version of the web page. I made sure the border radius 
is applied appropriately after the layout switches to the desktop version. I also adjusted the 
font size to account for bigger screens.
